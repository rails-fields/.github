Welcome to our GitHub organization, home of the [Rails-Fields](https://github.com/gastonmorixe/rails-fields) project! 

🚀 We're all about making your Ruby on Rails life easier and more fun. Our gem enforces field types and attributes for ActiveRecord models, ensuring your code is as clean and efficient as possible.

We offer automatic ActiveRecord Migrations generation 🦄, automatic GraphQL types generation, and explicit declarative model attributes annotation 📝. 

We're big on enforcement of fields declaration with real db columns 💪 and we also provide automatic YARD model documentation 📜 and more to come 🚀.

Join us in our quest to make Ruby on Rails development a breeze! 🎉
